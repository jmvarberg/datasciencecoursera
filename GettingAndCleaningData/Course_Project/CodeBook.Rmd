## Description of Variables and Transformations

Names of variables (column names) were only modified to be easier to read. The description of what each variable corresponds to can be found in the `features_info.txt` and `README.txt` files from the authors of the study.

Data were not transformed, except during the generation of the final tidy data output file. In this file, the values for each variable correspond to the mean value for the corresponding Subject and Activity.

Variables starting with "t" denote measurements in the time domain, while variables starting with "f" denote Fourier transformed measurements.
